  <h1> G'day </h1>
  <p> On this website, I will show you how I do some things. On the one hand can you explore MyThemeWay. I present you there the jekyll themes Dark- and Light-Particle. On the other hand can you dive into MyVimWay. I will introduce you there how I use Vim and a vim-like behavior in tmux and Zsh. In the future, I will add some further awesome stuff. So be curious what will come. Relax and enjoy. </p>
